          <h2>Redefining what a crypto wallet can be</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Phantom had established itself as the go-to wallet for Solana users, but their visual identity 
            hadn't evolved to match their growth. They needed a brand that could compete with fintech giants 
            while staying true to the Web3 ethos of accessibility and innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission was to create a brand system that would feel premium and trustworthy—essential 
            qualities for an app handling billions in digital assets—while maintaining the approachable, 
            user-friendly character that made Phantom successful in the first place.

      <h2>Setting a new standard</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The rebrand positioned Phantom as the premium choice in an increasingly crowded wallet market. 
        The new design system enabled the team to ship faster while maintaining visual consistency 
        across all touchpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, users responded positively to the evolution. The new brand felt like a natural 
        progression rather than a jarring change—exactly what we aimed for.
