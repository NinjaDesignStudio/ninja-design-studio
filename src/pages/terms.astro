          </ul>
          <p>

            project proposals or statements of work.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Project Engagement</h2>
          
          <h3>Proposals and Agreements</h3>
          <p>
            All projects begin with a written proposal outlining scope, deliverables, 
            timeline, and pricing. Work commences only after client approval and receipt 
            of the initial payment as specified in the proposal.
          </p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
            We communicate primarily via email, Telegram, or Slack as agreed upon. 
            Timely responses from both parties ensure projects stay on schedule. 
            Delays in client feedback may extend project timelines.
          </p>

          <h3>Revisions</h3>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, our proposals include a reasonable number of 
            revision rounds. Additional revisions beyond the agreed scope may incur 
            extra charges at our standard hourly rate.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
          
          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>
            All prices are quoted in USD unless otherwise specified. Pricing in proposals 
            is valid for 30 days from the proposal date.
          </p>

          <h3>Payment Schedule</h3>
          <p>
            For project-based work, we typically require:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>50% deposit to commence work</li>
            <li>50% upon project completion, before final file delivery</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For larger projects, milestones payments may be arranged. Retainer clients 
            are billed monthly in advance.
          </p>

          <h3>Late Payments</h3>
          <p>
            Invoices are due within 14 days unless otherwise agreed. Late payments may 
            result in work suspension and/or a late fee of 2% per month on outstanding 
            balances.
          </p>

          <h3>Accepted Payment Methods</h3>
          <p>
            We accept bank transfers, credit cards, and select cryptocurrencies 
            (USDC, USDT, ETH). Crypto payments are valued at the exchange rate at 
            the time of payment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
          
          <h3>Ownership Transfer</h3>
          <p>
            Upon full payment, all intellectual property rights to the final deliverables 
            transfer to the client. This includes source files, designs, and any custom 
            assets created specifically for the project.
          </p>

          <h3>Preliminary Work</h3>
          <p>
            Unused concepts, preliminary designs, and rejected directions remain our 
            property unless explicitly purchased by the client.
          </p>

          <h3>Third-Party Elements</h3>
          <p>
            Some projects may include third-party elements (fonts, stock images, icons) 
            which are subject to their respective licenses. We will inform you of any 
            licensing requirements.
          </p>

          <h3>Portfolio Rights</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to display completed work in our portfolio, case studies, 
            and marketing materials unless a non-disclosure agreement is in place. 
            We will not share confidential business information.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            We treat all client information as confidential. We will not disclose your 
            project details, business strategies, or proprietary information to third 
            parties without your consent, except as required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            For projects requiring enhanced confidentiality, we're happy to sign a 
            mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before discussions begin.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Project Cancellation</h2>
          
          <h3>Client Cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            If you cancel a project after work has commenced:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The deposit is non-refundable</li>
            <li>Work completed to date will be billed at our standard rate</li>
            <li>No ownership of work transfers until payment for completed work is received</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Our Right to Cancel</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to terminate a project if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Payment obligations are not met</li>
            <li>The project scope changes significantly without agreement</li>
            <li>Client conduct is unprofessional or abusive</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In such cases, payment for work completed is still due.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Warranties and Limitations</h2>
          
          <h3>Our Warranty</h3>
          <p>
            We warrant that our work will be original (except for licensed elements) 
            and will substantially conform to the agreed specifications. We will 
            correct any defects reported within 30 days of delivery at no extra charge.
          </p>

          <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Our total liability for any claim arising from our services shall not exceed 
            the total fees paid by you for the relevant project. We are not liable for 
            indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.
          </p>

          <h3>No Guarantee of Results</h3>
          <p>
            While we strive to create effective designs, we cannot guarantee specific 
            business outcomes such as sales, conversions, or user engagement. Design 
            is one factor among many in business success.
